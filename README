Embedit
-------

Embedit is an embedding tool written in Ruby.


Embedit is extremely simple to use. You have the url? Just plonk it in here =>

media = Embedit::Media.new('{URL}')

Thats it!

At the time of writing, you now have the ability to call:
	media.title => Shows the title of whatever was uploaded
	media.format => The format of the file
	media.url => The url to the media
	media.html => The embed code, whether this is a generic flash player, a company player (Vimeo, Youtube), image tag and more to come
	
  You also specify media sizes => media.html(:width => 200, :height => 700)
  
  You can also validate an url (useful for a active record (or whatever you use) validation)
  media.valid? => Returns true or false

	
At the moment Embedit supports: 
  - oEmbed family (http://www.oembed.com/) 
  - YouTube (http://youtube.com)
  - OVI (http://share.ovi.com/)
  - Google Video
  - Sevenload Video
  - .[jpg|gif|png] URL
  - Twitter (twictur.es)
  - Amazon product (thanks to: oohembed.com)
  - Slideshare (thanks to: oohembed.com)


How to add a new provider:

Every provider is a Class in the lib/embedit/providers folder. 
(Note that you need to name it correctly (for example: class name: SevenloadVide - filename: sevenload_video.rb))
Every provider should respond to: 
	- html(options={})
	- title 
	- format
	- url 
and there should be a class method "match" that accepts the URL as parameter and returns a match object or nil.
